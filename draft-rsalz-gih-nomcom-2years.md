--- abstract

Each year the NomCom process is actually two processes -- finding out anew
how to be a NomCom and conduct its business, and then undertaking the
work of the NomCom in selecting individuals to undertake the various roles
for which the NomCom has responsibility. This applies to both the chair and
to the voting volunteer members of the NomCom.

The inclusion of the past chair into the NomCom as a non-voting member
mitigates this to some extent, but the past chair is constrained as to the
level of advice that can be offerred.  This acts an impediment to making
concrete changes for future incarnations of the Nomcom that would improve
the overall Nomcom process.

The NomCom process could benefit from greater levels of continuity from year-to-year
to reduce the amount of time taken to by the new Nomcom to define its intended mode
of operation and allow the operation each incarnation of the Nomcom with a greater level
of consistency.

This document changes the term of office for NomCom voting volunteers from
one to two years.  It also changes the term of office for the NomCom Chair
from two to three.

# Introduction

Each year the IETF Nomincations Committee ("NomCom")
process {{!RFC8713}} is actually two processes -- finding out anew
how to be a NomCom and conduct its business and then secondly performing the
work of the NomCom in selecting individuals to undertake the various roles
for which the NomCom has responsibility. This applies to both the Chair and
to the voting volunteer members of the NomCom.

The inclusion of the past Chair into the NomCom as a non-voting member
mitigates this to some extent, but the past Chair is constrained as to the
level of advice that can be offerred. Even with such an arrangement, the
degree with which the previous chair can advocate adoption of previously
used processes (and supporting tools) that benefit the efficient operation
of the Nomcom is limited by being a single voice within the Nomcom.
Each incarnation of the Nomcom is prone to repeating the same behaviours
each year, with only a limited opportunity to benefit from previous experience.

The NomCom could benefit from greater levels of continuity from year-to-year
to assist the NomCom to get over the bootstrap period of operational process
definition each year.

This document changes the term of office for NomCom voting volunteers from
one to two years.  It also changes the term of office for the NomCom Chair
from two to three.

# Conventions and Definitions

{{!RFC8713}} documents how the IETF Nominations Committee
operates. That document refers to the meetings by ordinals; for ease of
understanding, this document uses March, July, and November instead of
First, Second, Third, respectively.

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Changes

The voting volunteers serve for two years.
The selection are to be staggered (see below) so that after the bootstrap
five new members are chosen each year.

The NomCom chair serves for three years, each year is known as
Incoming Chair, Chair, and Past Chair.
The voting rules for Chair and Past Chair do not change.
The Incoming Chair does not vote and does not count for quorum in
Nomcom meetings.

> **ISSUE** Is that last sentence what we want?

> **GH** Yes, I think so!

# Implementation

To commence this process, the ISOC President selects an individual as the
designated Chair, and an individual as the Incoming Chair.
The order and method of selection is left to the discretion of the ISOC
President.
This document recommends that the Incoming Chair be announced before
the current chair has made any public announcements. In suceeding years the
ISOC President selects an individual as the Incoming Chair.

The voting volunteers for the first year of operation of this process need to be selected in two
separate groups - five are picked for a one-year term, and five are picked
for a two-year term. In order to prevent the Chair from having undue
influence, {{!RFC3797}} or its successor should be used. The seed material
for both groups can be the same, with an additional seed provided that
distinguishes them. For example, an additional lottery equivalent with
"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6" as the numbers for the first group and
"7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12" as the numbers for the second group could be used.

A single list of eligible volunteers is used for both volunteer groups
in the first year of operation of this process.

In suceeding years the selection process will name five individuals to serve a two year
term as a Nomcom member.

If someone is unwilling, unreachable, or otherwise unable to serve,
the next person for that group should be chosen.

# Diversity Considerations

This comes from John Kleinsin (abridged) and I think makes some valid points.

~~~

I hope that proposal draft explicitly addresses the problem that,
perhaps because of the increased workload, the NomCom is already
less diverse and less representative of the community than one
might reasonably wish for.  I see it as a tradeoff, rather than
fatal but, unless there are other remedies, the longer commitment
of more time seems likely to further reduce diversity, perhaps to
the point that the typical NomCom member becomes someone with
good organizational support (perhaps from organizations/
companies with ulterior motives) and little significant
involvement in the IETF's technical work (aka "too much time on
their hands").

I don't have a strong opinion about what you should say on the
subject, but I believe not addressing the issue would be a
mistake.

~~~

# Security Considerations

The security considerations of {{Section 9 of RFC8713}} are still applicable.

In addition, since the term of office for the Chair and the voting volunteers
is being extended by a year, all will be participants in more than one
NomCom "session."
It seems obvious that this will make it harder to maintain confidentiality.
For example, a participant in years *N* and *N+1* will have to ensure
that they do not discuss *N+1* items with someone who was a participant
in *N* and *N-1*.

> **GH** I am not sure that the last 2 sentences are the case,

Note, however, that the key goal of this document is to introduce greater
continuity across NomComs.

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.

# LLC Considerations

The LLC is requested to provide free registration for the NomCom Chair
(and only the current Chair) and
the voting volunteers for the November meeting as that is when most of
the candidate interviews are done.

> **GH** Really? If the nomcom folk need free rego to to attend an IETF then
the wheels have fallen off in my view!
